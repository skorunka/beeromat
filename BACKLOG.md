# beeromat backlog

Informal capture of feature ideas that aren't yet specced via `/speckit`.
When one matures, run `/speckit-specify` and the item moves into
`specs/NNN-…/`.

## UX

- **Dedupe beer dropdowns onto the shared BeerPickerDropdown.** Spec
  029 introduced `components/picker/beer-picker-dropdown.tsx` (the
  common select-style beer dropdown) for the inline on-behalf log.
  Follow-up: the home one-tap chevron (`home-one-tap-log.tsx`) and
  the match bet-beer picker (`RecordResultForm.tsx`) each have their
  own inline beer dropdown — migrate them where the interaction fits
  (the one-tap chevron logs on tap rather than holding a value, so it
  may need a variant).

- **Beer breakdown on /settle + /history.** Spec 028 shipped the
  per-beer breakdown ("Pilsner ×3 · 120 Kč") on /tab only. Follow-ups:
  (a) /settle — show the breakdown at the literal payment moment;
  scope is the full outstanding balance which may span multiple
  unsettled sessions, so the grouping needs a cross-session source
  (bigger than the single-round /tab case). (b) /history/[sessionId]
  — reuse groupTabEntriesByBeer over a past session's entries (small;
  same helper). Both deferred from 028.

- **Per-row "repeat this match".** Spec 027 shipped one-tap recreate
  of the member's *single* last match on the /match hub. Follow-up:
  a "repeat" affordance on each row of the Upcoming list / agreement
  history so any *arbitrary* past matchup can be cloned, not just the
  most recent. Reuses the same clone path (createAgreementTx + the
  active-participant guard); would generalise `recreateLastMatchAction`
  to take a source `agreementId` (server-validated as club-scoped +
  member-visible). Deferred from 027 (out of scope).

- ~~**Persistent "I owe X to the club" badge on every page.**~~
  **— Shipped 2026-05-26.** AppHeader now renders a small amber
  `<BalanceBadge />` pill between the club name and the user-menu
  avatar when `balanceMinor > 0`. Tappable → `/tab`. Hidden when
  square. Reuses `memberBalance()` in `(app)/layout.tsx` (one extra
  query per render; small cost on this app's scale).

- ~~**One-tap "log a beer" on app open**~~ **— Shipped 2026-05-26 as
  spec 017** (`specs/017-home-onetap-log/`). Option 2 "same as last
  time" landed with the predictive-default button + fallback link
  to the full picker; archived + out-of-stock fall through gracefully.
  Home is now the action surface, not just an info display.

- ~~**Match-bet awareness on home**~~ **— Shipped 2026-05-26 as
  spec 018 MVP** (`specs/018-match-bet-home-awareness/`). Auto-create
  on settlement (Option A): match-settle transaction writes the
  winner's consumption + loser's bet_transfer atomically; loser
  sees "Útrata z dnešního zápasu: N× pivo" on home with a "Vrátit
  zápas" link. Match-void cascades to consumption + stock restore.
  Deferred follow-ups: (a) optional beer-picker UI in the
  match-result form (data-side ready via `betBeerOverrideId`),
  (b) /tab + admin "ze zápasu →" visual distinction.

- ~~**Log a beer on behalf of another member.**~~ **— Shipped
  2026-05-26 as spec 019** (`specs/019-log-for-other-member/`).
  "Zapsat pro jiného člena" link on home + /log opens a
  member-picker → beer-picker flow. Consumption created immediately
  (member_id=target, created_by_user_id=actor); absent member's
  home shows a review banner with one-tap "Vrátit" / "Nechat".
  Reject voids + restores stock; nobody auto-pays. /tab row
  expanded to 4 origin types (self / on-behalf "od X" /
  won-bet "ze zápasu →" / lost-bet "z prohrané sázky").
  voidConsumptionAction authz extended so the consumer can reject
  their own on-behalf logs.

- ~~**Spec 019 follow-up — admin balance view origin-type distinction.**~~
  **— Shipped 2026-05-26.** `/admin/balances/[memberId]` now
  renders the same 4 origin types `<TabEntryRow />` already
  shows on /tab. New sibling query `getMemberTabForAdmin` in
  `lib/db/queries/consumption.ts` (treasurer-shape — no `userId`
  arg because admin has no undo affordance, `canUndo` always
  false). Scoped to the current open session (older entries live
  in the member's /history); fetched alongside the balance +
  pending payments in the same `Promise.all`.

- ~~**Club name visible in the AppHeader.**~~ **— Shipped 2026-05-26.**
  AppHeader now stacks BrandMark on top of the active club name on
  the left side of the header, visible on every authenticated page.
  Truncates on narrow phones so the right-side BalanceBadge + avatar
  always fit.

- ~~**Date duplication on history list.**~~ **— Audited 2026-05-26,
  no duplication present in current code.** Walked through
  `/history`, `/history/[sessionId]`, `/account/payments`,
  `/admin/pending`, `/admin/members`, `/admin/beer-types/[id]/history`
  — each row renders the date once (or date + time together via one
  Intl.DateTimeFormat). Session titles default to null with a
  generic "Round / Kolo" fallback, no date is embedded there.
  Probably fixed during unrelated polish in an earlier session.
  Reopen if a screenshot surfaces.

- ~~**Pay-debt button on /tab.**~~ **— Shipped 2026-05-26.**
  /tab renders a prominent "Vyrovnat útratu" button below the
  session-total card when `memberBalance > 0`. Reads
  `memberBalance(ctx.member.id)` in the same `Promise.all` as
  the tab query.

- ~~**Header brand → home link.**~~ **— Shipped 2026-05-26.**
  AppHeader wraps BrandMark + the · separator + club-name in
  `<Link href="/">`. The right-side group (balance pill +
  user-menu avatar) is outside the link so taps on those don't
  navigate home.

- ~~**Fun avatar picker.**~~ **— Shipped 2026-05-27 as spec 020**
  (`specs/020-fun-avatar-picker/`). Member picks one of 8
  inline-SVG glyphs (beer-mug, tennis-ball, trophy, lightning,
  target, star, heart, sparkle) in a new `/account` section.
  Stored per-club seat on `members.avatar_key`. `<MemberAvatar />`
  renderer falls back to initials → CircleUser icon for missing
  data. Picker uses optimistic updates + a small scale-pop on
  selection (motion-reduce gated). Follow-up: render
  `<MemberAvatar />` next to member names in admin lists, /tab
  attribution, settle screens (today those surfaces are
  text-only, so the spec didn't require it).

- ~~**Refine language picker in the user-menu.**~~ **— Shipped
  2026-05-26.** The 2-tile CS/EN button grid was replaced with
  native `DropdownMenuRadioGroup` rows — one per locale, with a
  check mark on the active one. Labels use endonyms ("Čeština",
  "English") so a member sees their language by name regardless
  of current UI locale. Visual weight now matches the surrounding
  Account / Sign out rows; the JAZYK uppercase header is gone
  (the radio group implies "pick one").

- ~~**Money format without cents by default for compact UI.**~~
  **— Shipped 2026-05-26.** `formatMoneyCompact()` helper in
  `lib/format.ts` drops fractional units (`380 Kč` instead of
  `380,00 Kč`). Used by the AppHeader balance badge + the home
  one-tap log button. `formatMoney` unchanged everywhere else
  so amounts that need cents (EUR admin reconciliation, payment
  history) still get them.

- ~~**Fancy beer animation on log.**~~ **— Shipped 2026-05-26.**
  Every successful log (one-tap, /log grid, /log/for) fires a
  global 🍻 + 🍺-fountain overlay. Centerpiece 🍻 pops in
  scaled, eight 🍺 mug particles fountain outward in a 90°
  arc (~1.2s total). Dispatched via `celebrateBeer()` in
  lib/celebrate.ts → `<BeerCelebration />` mounted in the
  locale layout listens on a window CustomEvent and renders
  the overlay. CSS-only animation; motion-reduce:hidden skips
  the overlay entirely for users who've requested reduced
  motion (the toast still confirms verbally).

- ~~**/account stub rows.**~~ **— Closed 2026-05-27.** Change
  PIN + Sign out from all devices both shipped. Change e-mail
  dropped from scope per user direction — e-mail is the immutable
  account identity (the address that received the original magic
  link), shown as a read-only subtitle under the /account title.
  If a member needs to change their address they re-onboard.

- ~~**Refine the bottom nav.**~~ **— Shipped 2026-05-26.** Log
  and Tab dropped from the bottom nav. Bottom nav is now
  Home / Bet / History (+ role-gated). Rationale: home
  (spec 017+018) is the action surface for log + balance + bet
  awareness + settle; the AppHeader balance pill (shipped today)
  provides the secondary route to /tab; the "Vyber jiné pivo →"
  link on home keeps /log reachable. Both pages remain functional
  as deep links — only the nav entry is gone. If the simplification
  proves too aggressive (muscle memory complaints), the entries
  re-add in one line of layout.tsx.
